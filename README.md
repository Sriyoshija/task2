# task2 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Objective:
To understand the dataset thoroughly using statistical summaries and visualizations, enabling better insights, feature understanding, and data cleaning strategies.

Tools Used:
Pandas for data manipulation
Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly for visualizations

**Approach & Methodology**
Data Overview:
The dataset's shape, columns, data types, and missing values were inspected to assess the data's structure and quality.

Summary Statistics:
Generated descriptive statistics such as mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, maximum, and quartiles for all features to understand data distribution and identify anomalies.

Visualizations for Numeric Features:
1. Histograms: To visualize the distribution of each numeric feature, highlighting skewness or normality.
2. Boxplots: To detect outliers and understand the spread and variability of features.
3. Correlation Matrix & Heatmap: To analyze relationships between numeric features, identifying highly correlated pairs for potential feature reduction or multicollinearity issues.
4. Pairplot: To examine pairwise relationships and potential clusters among numeric features.
5. 3D/2D Scatter Plots: Interactive visualizations to explore relationships in multi-dimensional space.

Visualizations for Categorical Features:
Count plots illustrate the distribution of categories in categorical columns, revealing imbalances or dominant classes.

Insights:
Visualizations and statistics reveal patterns like distribution shapes, outliers, correlations, and categorical distributions, aiding feature engineering and data cleaning.
